# Neutralinator

## Project Description

**Neutralinator** is a project developed as part of the *Prototyping Interactive Systems* course, aiming to create innovative solutions for real-world problems. The course fosters interdisciplinary learning, combining design, engineering, and interactive product development.

## Course Overview

*Prototyping Interactive Systems* is a comprehensive course that introduces students to the world of design and innovation. Participants acquire engineering skills required for building physical prototypes, learning interactive product design, form aesthetics, and problem-solving. The course blends theoretical knowledge with hands-on activities, using different materials, microcontrollers, and power tools to create functional prototypes.

The course concludes with a major group project, wherein students identify impactful problems and design solutions. The goal is to plan, build, and showcase a functional prototype to address the identified issue.

## Project Details

**Problem Statement:** Acidic water bodies affect marine life, impacting both nature and human livelihoods. The project's focus is to neutralize acidic water in ponds and lakes, creating a positive environmental impact.

**Solution:** **Neutralinator** is a prototype designed to neutralize acidic water, improving the pH levels to a safe range of 7-8. This innovative machine employs an Arduino UNO, pH sensor, peristaltic water pump, LCD display, and a volume input keypad.

## Components

- Arduino UNO
- pH Sensor
- Peristaltic Water Pump
- LCD Display
- Volume Input Keypad

## Functionality

Upon powering the Neutralinator, it displays the initial pH of the water body. The user inputs the available volume, which helps calculate the amount of base required for neutralization. The machine then dispenses the necessary base, raising the water's pH to a safe level. A reassuring "Water is Safe" message is displayed upon successful neutralization.
